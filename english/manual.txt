        "text" : "Greetings and welcome to the incredible\"LUCH-12\". In this user guide we will introduce you to the innovations that have resulted from the twelfth version of a long and successful line of innovative portable interfaces.\n\nThe\"LUCH -12\" was designed by two outstanding scientists Dr. Ken Takayanagi and Prof. Iliya Zworykin in K.B. SVET,  as a personal assistant and health monitor in one easy to use, compact device.\n\nIn this twelfth version of LUCH we have made vast improvements which allow a much higher screen resolution, 20% faster processor and multitasking which allows you to have two different tabs active at once.\n\nAll the important information about your \“LUCH-12\” is contained here and can be accessed at any time. Please read the manual carefully, your life and/or safety may depend on it.\n\nAdditional information about the city, locations and people can be obtained from \"EUREKA\" terminals. If you are new to the city, please remember to download the tourist map to your \“LUCH-12\” from the nearest terminal.\n\nThank you for using LUCH -12\n\n\nK.B. SVET",

All interactable objects are highlighted with different colours: orange - hideouts, blue -  lootable items, green - doors and portals, places for sleep - yellow, dead enemies - red.\n\n\"C\" - Focuses your character's hearing. Focus hearing reveals hidden or obscured enemies and their sight field.

Standing by the fire quickly restores your body temperature to normal, although the farther you stand from the fire the less benefit you will get from it.\n\nThe fire has a limited duration, but it can be extended by adding extra wood to it while it's active.\n\nAll raw ingredients, which are inedible in their initial state, can be cooked on a campfire. Cooked food will have a more positive effect on replenishing hunger and will also slightly increase body temperature. Basic food recipes are stored in LUCH-12 in the Crafting section.",

However, severity of needs varies from person to person; some are slim and nimble and require less provision, while others are stronger and more resilient, thus need more resources to keep going.\n\nFood and Drinks can be consumed from the Inventory tab, by clicking on them with RMB or by pressing \"Q\" , if the item is equipped in a Supplementary Item slot.\n\nIn the INFO tab of the LUCH-12 all vital parameters of the character are displayed.  Keep a close eye on them, otherwise you might not be able to survive your next encounter.\n\nCold is a threat the character is constantly exposed to. Warm clothes, alcoholic drinks, heated food, campfires and running are things that can prevent or diminish frostbite. Some buildings can provide a moderate shelter from cold.\n\nThe character can carry only a limited amount of weight in his/her base inventory. This limit is different for every character, and mainly depends on his/her strengths. Once the limit has been exceeded, the character becomes overloaded and is unable to run. Fatigue will also build quicker, when overloaded.\n\nThe capacity of the base inventory can be increased by equipping extra bags and backpacks.\n\nThese extra bags, pouches or backpacks can be  found in the World and simply equipped in the inventory tab.\n\nYour character cannot attack while running. Once you start attacking, the character will automatically stop running and toggle to walking. If you run with a weapon and want to attack the first click will place your character back into walk mode, upon the second click he/she will perform the attack.When you are in walk or crouch mode you can start attacking immediately.",
